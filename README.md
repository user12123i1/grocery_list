# grocery_list
# this is a grocery list, developed by Isaac Lowenstein, with help from Maksym Napora 
# This helps you enter shopping list items into a list, and check entries as completed as you get them. 
# make sure to follow the prompts when entering your data, it's important to send numbers when it calls for numbers, and strings when the program asks for strings.
